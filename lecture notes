Repository


The Central interface in the Spring Data repository abstraction is Repository. It takes the domain
class to manage as well as the ID type of the domain class as type argument.
This interface acts primarily as a marker interface to capture the types
to work with to help you to discover interfaces that extend this one


 Spring Data provides persistence technology-specific abstractions, such as JpaRepository or MongoRepository.
 Those interfaces extend CrudRepository and expose the capabilities of the underlying
 persistence technology in addition to the rather generic percictence technology-agnostic interfaces such as
 CrudRepository

 Auditing
 Spring Data provides sophisticated support to transparently keep track of who created or changed an entity
 and when the change happened. To benefit from that functionality, you have to equip your entity classes with auditing
 metadata that can be defined either using annotations or by implementing an interface.
